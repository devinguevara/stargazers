## Self-Evaluations:

#### Samia Afrose 
1. I spent about 18-22 hours working on this project. I created the visualization module and integration test for it. I helped in the project planning and assignements. I completed all the tasks assigned to me after we divided them in our meetings. I helped my peers when requested.
