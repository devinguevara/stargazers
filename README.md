# team27_2023 

## Self-Evaluations:











#### Devin Guevara 
1. I spent about 20 hours working on this project. I created the query, preprocessing, and test_integration functionalities. I asisted in the planning of this project, as well with the set up of the remote repository. I also helped others improve and develop their code as needed. This was a super fun project!
