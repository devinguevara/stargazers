   SDSS Database Query Module

   This module is designed to facilitate querying the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database using
   the Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL). It provides a simple yet powerful interface for
   astronomers and astrophysicists to retrieve astronomical data for analysis. The module leverages
   the capabilities of the 'astroquery.sdss' library and Pandas to handle and manipulate the queried data.

   The core of this module is the `Query` class, which allows users to execute ADQL queries and
   retrieve results in various formats, including Pandas DataFrames and Astropy Tables. This class
   handles the complexities of database connectivity and query execution, providing a user-friendly
   interface for data retrieval.

   Classes:
   --------
   Query : A class that encapsulates ADQL queries to the SDSS database. It provides methods to
           execute queries and retrieve results in different formats.

   The module assumes that the user has basic knowledge of ADQL and the structure of the SDSS database.
   It is intended for use in astronomical research and education, providing a straightforward way to
   access one of the most comprehensive astronomical databases available.

   Example:
   --------
   To use this module, simply import it along with the required 'astroquery.sdss' and 'pandas' libraries.
   Create an instance of the Query class with your ADQL query, and use the provided methods to retrieve
   and manipulate the data:

   # Import the required libraries and this module.

   # Example ADQL query
   query_string = "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM specObj WHERE class = 'GALAXY'"

   # Create a Query instance
   query = Query(query_string)

   # Retrieve the result as a Pandas DataFrame
   data_frame = query.get_df()

   # Alternatively, retrieve the result as an Astropy Table
   astro_table = query.get_table()

   # Or simply print the query result
   query.print()

   Dependencies:
   -------------
   - astroquery
   - pandas

.. py:class:: Query(ADQL_string: str)


   A class for querying the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database using ADQL (Astronomical Data Query Language).

   This class provides methods to execute ADQL queries against the SDSS database and retrieve results
   in different formats such as pandas DataFrame, Astropy Table, or simply print the results.

   Attributes:
   -----------
   ADQL_string : str
       The ADQL query string to be executed against the SDSS database.

   Methods:
   --------
   get_df():
       Executes the ADQL query and returns the result as a pandas DataFrame.

   get_table():
       Executes the ADQL query and returns the result as an Astropy Table.

   print():
       Executes the ADQL query and prints the result.

   .. py:method:: get_df()

      Executes the stored ADQL query and returns the results as a pandas DataFrame.

      Returns:
      --------
      pandas.DataFrame
          A DataFrame containing the query results.

      Raises:
      -------
      Exception
          If an error occurs during the query execution or data conversion.


   .. py:method:: get_table()

      Executes the stored ADQL query and returns the results as an Astropy Table.

      Returns:
      --------
      astropy.table.Table
          An Astropy Table containing the query results.

      Raises:
      -------
      Exception
          If an error occurs during the query execution.


   .. py:method:: print()

      Executes the stored ADQL query and prints the results.

      This method is useful for quick checks or debugging purposes.

      Raises:
      -------
      Exception
          If an error occurs during the query execution.
